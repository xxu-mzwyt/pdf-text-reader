# pdf-text-reader
.pdf to .txt script using pdfminer.

### There is an error somewhere and it's not working. Maybe an unsupported version of the pdfminer library.
### However, I'm currently using [Poppler](https://poppler.freedesktop.org/) and it works well. Thus I don't think I'll be solving this problem in the near future.
